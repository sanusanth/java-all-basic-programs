What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games
Database connection
And much, much more!
Why Use Java?
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It is open-source and free
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa


Setup for Windows
To install Java on Windows:

Go to "System Properties" (Can be found on Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings)
Click on the "Environment variables" button under the "Advanced" tab
Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button
Click on the "New" button and add the path where Java is installed, followed by \bin. By default, Java is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1 (If nothing else was specified when you installed it). In that case, You will have to add a new path with: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin
Then, click "OK", and save the settings
At last, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type java -version to see if Java is running on your machine


Keyword   	        Description
abstract	             A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another                         class). An  abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
